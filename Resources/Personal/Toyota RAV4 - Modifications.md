- [ ] Trailer Hitch
	- [RAV4 EcoHitch](https://torkliftcentral.com/x7396)
	- There are basically 3 options, an OEM hitch, the EcoHitch, and the Curt hitch.
		- OEM Hitch blocks the Kick Sensor and is harder to self-install (installation at Toyota est. 1.5k)
		- Curt Hitch sits lower than the EcoHitch, and can scrape against the ground
		- EcoHitch sits higher, you _can_ cut the bumper to install, but most people say it is not necessary and it sits higher than the Curt Hitch, hence why we chose it.
- [ ] Crossbars
	- [ ] _Thule?_ - OEM Crossbars do not appear to be needed
