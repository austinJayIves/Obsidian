	- Why MongoDB Atlas over DynamoDB if you are already using AWS tech (KMS / SES)
	- Why two different DB techs? MySql + MongoDB
## Maverick of Atlas
- > This is a demo site created by Reagan Ives. All products are for demonstration purposes only.
	- This has a tendency to flash in and out on my screen upon hovering over it
- Might want to add some padding in header for buttons (Register, Login, etc)
- The icon behind color / size in the item page is a bit distracting. Might want to remove it
## Github
- If you link it from your personal site, there should be some additional information here - currently with 0 public repositories, 
## Everyday Carry
- Do you really want to provide this type of information publicly to employers?
	  - Ex. Your last played Spotify song
## Additional Experience you might want to add
- CI/CD
	- https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd
	- Example using Github Actions: https://github.blog/enterprise-software/ci-cd/build-ci-cd-pipeline-github-actions-four-steps/
	- Possible vercel does some of this for you, but you should be able to discuss deployment strategy and automated testing.
- Regarding Web Development
	- Would be a good idea to check out a few of these to round out experience
		- Languages:
			- Typescript - Pretty ubiquitous in Web Development
			- Java / Kotlin - Good to demonstrate OOP principles
				- Recommend a book like https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/ as well to brush up on these - they are fairly common interview Qs
		- Testing frameworks, unit testing, integration testing and E2E Testing.
			- Ex. https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5/testing_react_apps
		- Deployment / 
			- Check out Docker if you haven't already
				- Vercel created a container for you upon build - I'd recommend as an exercise writing a Dockerfile to replicate.
			- 
- Screen Frameworking tools
	- Ex. Figma
