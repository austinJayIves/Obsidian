### Summary
I recently built the Adam Lilith kit - my main reservations with the kit were that the "Lego" parts used were not officially licensed or manufactured by Lego. Lego is known to have some crazy good tolerances on the parts that they create, so I'm curious how a fully "Lego" kit would hold up. 

In order to build one, I'm listing down the parts that would be required to build it, and then the additional parts that I'd likely be able to purchase from Adam to make it work.
