"This is why we need therapy, because you have no idea how to support me"
- This feels like an accusation - like the reason we need therapy is because I'm inferior - I'm the one who "cannot figure it out". It doesn't put the perspective on an equal footing, and negates the entire part of Elena's responsibility here as well. 
- It's not fair to call me out for "not being supportive" when Elena gets _mean_ when she's going through it - yelling, calling names, etc.
- "Fuck you" - core example
