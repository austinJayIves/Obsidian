## Summary
Vex is a feature flag management system for managing feature flags across a whole fleet of services. 

The goal of Vex is to be flexible to work in multiple domains, ergonomic for use, and simple to get up and running.
### Aside 
Frankly, I'm building Vex as an opportunity to get my hands dirty with learning the in's and out's of a feature flag system - I really think there's value in leveraging feature flags during development, but I can't know that for certain unless I evaluate.
