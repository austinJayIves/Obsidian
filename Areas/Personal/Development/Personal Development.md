## Summary
This focus area is specifically for projects and development topics that are personal, ie. not related to work. That is not to say they cannot help with becoming a better engineer or advancing my career, they just aren't created out of a necessity for a work function.
## Current Projects
- [[Neovim Configuration]]
- [[Templating for Neovim]]
- [[Learning Bruno]]
- [[Configuring Git for Obsidian]] 
## Risks
N/A - These are for my own development. There are no risks, hence the beauty of it :)
## Quick Resources
*Provide any relevant resources for quick reference*
