## Summary
In order to be able to recall notes from multiple sources, I need to be able to sync my notes up to a centralized repository. Having these notes stored in a service like Git allows me to pull them down and use them wherever I'd like.
## Resources of Note
N/A - This is a one time ask, no follow up or resources needed. Will be moving to Archive when needed.
## Status
- Have set up Git for Windows (and for OSX/Linux)
- Currently, need to configure git in Obsidian to ensure that the repo information is set up correctly

## Action Items
- [x] Currently, need to configure git in Obsidian to ensure that the repo information is set up correctly
- [ ] Awaiting to see if this will work? Have set Git to sync every 60 minutes.

## Due Dates
- If I don't get this done today, I likely won't.
