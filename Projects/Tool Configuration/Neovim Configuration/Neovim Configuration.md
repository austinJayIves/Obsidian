## Summary
I need to configure my Neovim configuration to make best use of the software. In addition, I plan to research and follow through with _actually_ learning how to leverage vim effectively. This is something I've wanted to do for some time now, so learning how to do so will be essential in becoming a better engineer.

## Resources of Note
- [[NeoVim Resources]]
## Status
- Currently, I've looked at the [Neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/wiki/index/getting-started/) subreddit, and have noted a few new resources for getting started. Additionally, I've already written a bit of Neovim configuration myself, but don't have much of an understanding of Lua to write an advanced configuration. 
## Action Items
-  [ ] Go through the [VIM for Beginners](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-commands-beginner/) guide
-  [ ] Use [Kickstart.vim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) - Test out how the interface feels
-  [ ] Learn how to write Lua (correctly)
## Due Dates
