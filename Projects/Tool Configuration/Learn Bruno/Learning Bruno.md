## Summary
Bruno is meant to be an open-source replacement for both Postman and Insomnia. Both postman and insomnia have made some questionable decisions as of late, mostly by focusing on making their service a "cloud-based" one, rather than just a wrapper for `curl`, like it should be :)

This project is to learn how to leverage Bruno, and to write a few small collections in Bruno to make sure I know how to use it effectively.
## Resources of Note
- [Bruno Landing Page](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/usebruno/bruno&ved=2ahUKEwj76bKA75CFAxVaDTQIHaV4CVwQFnoECAcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0-SVMdf8pkzmADHprZz6A-)
- [Bruno Documentation](https://docs.usebruno.com/) - Documentation for scripting and assertions in Bruno
	- I like the `.env` approach. It makes secret handling easy! :)
	
## Status
- Have installed bruno `winget install Bruno.Bruno` and toyed around with it a bit. Planning on adding a collection to it for interfacing with Vex
## Action Items
-  [ ] Add a collection to Bruno for interfacing with Vex, determine if it meets my needs, if so consider switching from Postman to Bruno for development
