## Summary
In this project, I aim to create a templating SOP for making a series of templates that allow for better note taking on a particular area or topic.

## Resources of Note
- [[Obsidian SOP and Processes]]

## Status
- Have read the [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html) documentation and have a good enough understanding of how best to use it with templates
- Have created a few small templates. Will continue to fill these out as necessary
## Action Items
- [x] Read documentation for the Templater Plugin
- [] Determine any additional Obsidian plugins that may make life easier for navigating through pages
