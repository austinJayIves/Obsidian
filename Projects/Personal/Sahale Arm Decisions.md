## Recommendations
> Agreed with the other comment so far; Aug is a good time to go. I've camped up there four times in both Aug and Sept and have had every type of weather: Perfect, snow, thunderstorms, wind, rain, you name it. Even a lightning strike below us that started a fire. August has a slightly higher chance of strong thunderstorms and downpours; people have been briefly stranded up there when the road washed out during an Aug t-storm.
   You'll need at least a puffy, rainshell (that fits over the puffy), and layers and you'll be fine. Have a stout tent, as you may not get one of the more protected campsites, and TBH, the 'protected' campsites on the rock-walled mounds are always exposed; some of the ones just below/behind them are far more wind-protected.
   Mice will be present, so be prepared for that and store all your food items in critter-proof containers. Goats and marmots are very common in search of your salts. And hopefully you'll see the 'Doubtful Bear' as you hike the Arm. Nearly all the wildlife you'll encounter is very habituated and won't pay much notice. I had to side-step a deer and its fawn that would not move off the trail no matter how much racket we made.
   And of course, keep an eye on road conditions, as it opens and closes at any time due to washouts (as mentioned above). Last year, they finished a big repair, only to have it washout just as bad like a week or two later.

> **Do not expect your cell phone to work.** We had minimal cellular service on this hike. There is also no cellular service along most of Cascade River Road, which means you won’t get reception for most of the drive to the trailhead. Don’t depend on your phone to call for help, talk to friends, or to send photos to friends and family.
## Info
- Should be runoffs on the hike for additional water
- Running water near campsite (as reported by )
