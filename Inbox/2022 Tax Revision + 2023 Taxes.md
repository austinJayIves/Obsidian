## Summary
The goal of this document is to organize our 2022 Tax revision, as well as prepare our 2023 Tax Return. These two have been grouped together due to being connected across a Roth Contribution that needs to be corrected in our 2022 Taxes.

### Problem

During 2022, Elena contributed the maximum amount to her Roth IRA, $6000. 

Later that year, Elena and I got married, and we chose to file jointly for this year. This meant that her initial $6,000 contribution to her Roth IRA was not permitted, as her income jumped from being underneath the threshold to well above after our marriage. 

In order to mitigate this, we calculated the contribution and any loss / earnings on that contribution and withdrew it from the Roth IRA. We meant for this withdrawal to be a corrective withdrawal, not a early distribution. However, it appears we did not perform this withdrawal in a way to have our Broker, Fidelity classify it correctly. 

Lastly, after our withdrawal was completed, Elena contributed the same amount ($6,000) to a Traditional IRA, and subsequently converted this contribution to her Roth IRA, via the "backdoor" method. 

At the time, I do not believe we reported the contribution to a Roth IRA and subsequent withdrawal on our 2022 Taxes. It has been quite some time since then, but I believe our belief was that because it was corrected, there was nothing to report. However, upon looking into it further, it appears we should have reported the Roth Contribution, as well as the corrective withdrawal on our 2022 Taxes as well.
